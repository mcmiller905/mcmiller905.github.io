## Spotify Sidecar

Once I started working from home in 2020, I realized that I was always swiping back in forth between my remote work machine and my local machine to check what song was playing on my Spotify. This project solved that problem by combining a Node.js webapp connected to Spotify's Web API with a Raspberry Pi 0 and Adafruit 2.8 inch screen. This repo contains the code for the webapp.

## nand2tetris

Being a software developer and primarily working in higher-orders levels of programming, I had always been interested in the fundamentals of how computers work. Following along with the Nand2Tetris project in "The Elements of Computing Systems" was a great way to build a computer from the ground up.

I've used the Advent of Code events as a way to learn and improve my knowledge of Python. I have repositories for 2020 and 2021 up, and I'm working on finishing them both.

## Machine Learning Coursework - Coursera

I took Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera, this repo contains the coursework for it. This was a great way to learn the math behind a lot of popular ML algorithms and get an inside look at the concepts of AI image processing and generation.
