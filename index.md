## Spotify Sidecar

Once I started working from home in 2020, I realized that I was always switching back in forth between my remote work machine and my local machine to check what song was playing on my Spotify.

I've used the Advent of Code events as a way to learn and improve my knowlege of Python. I have repositories for 2020 and 2021 up, and I'm working on finishing them both.
