# Spotify Sidecar

This project was a great way to both play aound with Spotify's Web API and set up a headless Raspberry Pi 0. I love the concept of the Raspberry Pi, and I've made a few emulators in the past, but I've always wanted to do more with them. The idea of using a tiny computer-on-a-chip to solve problems and do tasks seems so cyberpunk and powerful. The problem I kept running into however, was I couldn't think of any problems to solve. A lot of my day was already 'convenienced' enough that an additional computer or screen would just add more complication.

Once I started working from home however, I realized that I kept swiping away from my work's remote desktop to my local Spotify session to see what song was playing. It gave me the idea to have a separate screen dedicated to displaying and controlling what I was listening to.

For years I had been thinking of different apps to build using a connection to Spotify, so I was already aware of its API.
