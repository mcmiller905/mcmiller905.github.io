# nand2tetris

This is the working repository for my work following the nand2tetris project as lined out in _The Elements of Computing Systems_ by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. I'm currently working through chapter 7 of 13.

Getting a degree in Computer Science and working as a Software Developer, my understanding of a computer's hardware only ever went as deep as the Assembly language. When I found out about the nand2tetris project, I thought it sounded like a perfect way to learn how every level of a computer works from the bottom up. I had learned the basics of circuits and logic gates, but it was exciting to learn how binary commands are processed through a CPU's ALU and how memory gets accessed. 

The lowest level of computer architecture has always been a black-box to me, but this project has really explained a lot of the intricacies that go into its processing.
